package versions


v0.9.0
 26.09.2024

  - NEW: the attribute <node>.notes might be used to get and set a plaintext
         value to the node's notes. analogous to the details attribute.
         consequently, the keyword argument "notes" can be used within the
         methods <mindmap>.find_nodes(), <node>.find_nodes() and
         <node>.find_children() to look for appropriate nodes.

  - NEW: the keyword argument "caseinsensitive=True" can be used in addition
         to the argument "exact=True" within the methods <mindmap>.find_nodes(),
         <node>.find_nodes() and <node>.find_children() to ensure that all
         textual comparisons will be performed in a case-insensitive way,
         although the text is expected to be exact. this setting will be
         relevant for checking the attributes core, link, details and notes.
